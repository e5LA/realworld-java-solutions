# RealWorld Java Solutions

A practical set of **production-inspired Java solutions** showing how to handle real-world use cases, architectural patterns, and processing strategies â€” beyond simple CRUD.


---

## Why This Project?

Most open-source Java examples are limited to basic CRUD or demo apps. This repository bridges that gap by showing real-world backend solutions that reflect the complexity and design choices faced by experienced engineers.
