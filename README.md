# RealWorld Java Systems

A practical set of **production-inspired Java projects** showing how to handle real-world use cases, architecture patterns, and processing logic â€” beyond simple CRUD


Each system is **self-contained** and built using modern Java tooling, covering patterns like:
- Synchronous and asynchronous processing
- Event-driven architecture with messaging queues
- Scheduled and batch data processing
- Streaming and real-time data pipelines
- Workflow orchestration and state management
- Multi-tenancy and context isolation
- Configuration and feature flag management
- Secure file handling and data encryption
- Observability: logging, tracing, metrics
- Resilience: retries, circuit breakers, backpressure
- Schema versioning and data validation
- Infrastructure as code and containerization

ðŸ“¦ Designed to be **modular, independent, and contributor-friendly.**

## Why This Project?

Most open-source Java examples are limited to basic CRUD or demo apps. This repository bridges that gap by showcasing real-world backend systems that reflect the complexity and design choices faced by experienced engineers.
